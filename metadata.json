    "Description":
        "Prediction of antimicrobial potential using a dataset of 29537 compounds screened against the antibiotic resistant pathogen Burkholderia cenocepacia. The model uses the Chemprop Direct Message Passing Neural Network (D-MPNN) abd has an AUC score of 0.823 for the test set. It has been used to virtually screen the FDA approved drugs as well as a collection of natural product list (>200k compounds) with hit rates of 26% and 12% respectively"
